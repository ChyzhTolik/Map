# To build a project you need to clone the repository. All needed third party files are stored in the folder Dependencies. To run the program there must be a folder "res" with the shader file neat the .exe file. All the tiles are being downloaded from the site "geojson.io". So in the file "comnfig.ini" must be an url to the tiles and the working token. This file also must be near the .exe file.
